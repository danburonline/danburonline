My name is Daniel Burger, and Iâ€™m a 23-year-old software engineer with multiple years of interdisciplinary work experience in a technological diverse background. Currently, Iâ€™m developing software at Hexagon AB and studying web development at the Middlesex University. In my spare time, I experiment with brain-machine interfaces, machine learning and virtual reality.
