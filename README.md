I’m a versatile software engineer with interdisciplinary professional experience in a technologically diverse environment dedicated to clean code and lean architectures. Currently, I’m developing neuroinformatics software at the [Blue Brain Project](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/bluebrain), running AI on brain organoids at [FinalSpark](https://finalspark.com) and studying applied neuroscience at [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk). Generally, I’m always interested in alternative computing paradigms, such as quantum, cognitive, and spatial computing.
