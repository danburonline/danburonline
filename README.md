# Gr√ºezi world

Full-stack software engineer with several years of interdisciplinary work experience in a technologically diverse background dedicated to clean code and lean architectures. Currently, I'm developing brain-machine interface software at [IDUN Technologies](https://iduntechnologies.ch) and studying web development with a focus on spatial computing at [Middlesex University](https://www.mdx.ac.uk). In my spare time, I enjoy experimenting with artificial intelligence and reading about neuroscience and philosophy.
