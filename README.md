Interdisciplinary **neuroengineer developing augmented progressive brain replacement** — a radical procedure for treating neurodegeneration, brain injuries, and ageing through patient-specific neural grafts designed for piece-wise replacement and neuronal-level modulation. I lead [Eightsix Science](https://eightsix.science/), an applied neuroscience startup I founded, to combine neural tissue engineering, biohybrid brain-computer interfaces, and microsurgery to seamlessly integrate these optimised grafts with the host’s brain. Ultimately, we **aim to achieve ectopic cognitive preservation**, an approach to sustain cognition outside its original biological context and potentially within virtual reality.

Building on a background in wetware computing, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience, I have contributed to projects ranging from whole-brain simulations at the [Blue Brain Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project) to closed-loop control of virtual avatars using human brain organoids at [FinalSpark](https://finalspark.com).

I bring rigorously systematic and holistic strategies to overcome ageing as a disease and push neurotechnology’s boundaries. Fundamentally, I treat death as an engineering challenge to be solved and aspire to **research better substrates for synthetic consciousness** in the long run.
