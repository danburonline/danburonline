Versatile software engineer with interdisciplinary professional experience in a technologically diverse environment dedicated to clean code and lean architectures. I am currently developing brain-computer interface software at [IDUN Technologies](https://iduntechnologies.com) and studying machine learning with a focus on spatial computing in a handful of boot camps. In my spare time, I enjoy maths and reading about neuroscience, physics and quantum computing.
